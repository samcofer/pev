# Architecture

`pev` follows a small, deliberately conventional Go layout that mirrors `sol-eng/wbi` for SE familiarity.

```
main.go ──► cmd/* (cobra)
              │
              ├─► internal/discover  ── reads /proc, os-release, hostname, /opt/{R,python,quarto}
              ├─► internal/operatingsystem  ── /etc/os-release first; Alma/Rocky → rhel-<major>
              ├─► internal/checks (engine)
              │     ├─► loader: walk go:embed FS + filesystem packs
              │     ├─► registry: primitive name -> Runner func
              │     ├─► engine: applies_to filtering, root gating, template expansion
              │     └─► lint: schema validation
              │
              ├─► internal/primitives (cmd, file, dir, port, dns, http, x509, pkg, proc, sysctl, sizing)
              │     └─► system.RunCaptured (the only os/exec entry point)
              │
              ├─► internal/logging  ── logrus JSON logger + replayable cmdlog
              └─► internal/report   ── Markdown + JSON renderers + Diff
```

## Data flow per `pev assess`

1. Parse flags. Initialize logger and cmdlog (under `--out-dir`).
2. `discover.Gather()` populates `HostFacts` (read-only).
3. Resolve selected products from `--products` / `--profile` / discovery.
4. Load the catalog: embedded YAML packs + `--checks-file` files + `~/.config/pev/checks.d/*.yaml`.
5. Lint the catalog — fail fast if any pack is malformed.
6. Filter checks by `Products`, `Tags`, `SkipTags`, `SkipIDs`, `SeverityMin`.
7. For each check (sequentially, for deterministic cmdlog ordering):
   - `applies_to` gate, `requires_root` gate
   - Expand `{{ .Inputs.X }}` and `{{ .Facts.Y }}` in `with:`
   - Dispatch to the registered primitive
   - Record a `Result`
8. Sort `Results` by ID; render Markdown + JSON; write the report files.
9. Exit 1 iff any `blocking` failures remain.

## Why the splits look the way they do

- **`internal/system` is the only `os/exec` entry point.** Every shell-out flows through `RunCaptured`, which gives us per-command timeouts, captured stdout/stderr, and a single audit hook.
- **Primitives can't see each other.** Each registers itself via `init()`. New primitives are additive; you can't accidentally make one depend on another's internals.
- **Reports never run anything.** `internal/report/` reads JSON files and produces strings. That makes `pev diff` trivially safe to run on archived sidecars and easy to unit-test.
- **The engine never aborts.** Failures, skips, and unknowns are all results — there are no error paths from the engine to the caller. The CLI uses `Summary.Blocking > 0` to decide the process exit code.
